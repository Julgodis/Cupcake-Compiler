# Cupcake
Cupcake is a compiler for Jonathan Blows new programming language **JAI**. The compiler is build from the ideas and temporary specification that Blow gives in his youtube/twitch [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888/videos). Cupcake has almost everything that Jonathan Blow has shown in his videos so far (2016-06-12). 

Both me and Cupcake has no association with Jonathan Blow. The experience you have with Cupcake will not reflect how much you liek or dislike JAI. Cupcake is a hobby project of my, to let me learn how i real compiler works. 

### Features ###

------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
[Base language, compile-time execution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTqZNujQOlA)  | Fully Implemented | Good Enough
[Iteration and arrays, uninitialized values, enums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UPFH0eWHEI)  | Everything but inlining | Good Enough

# Source Code? #

I have decided to not release the source code yet. Why is because a don't know if it would be fair for Jonathan Blow and I am not very proud of the code. There is a huge amount of unnecessery code that could be removed, Cupcake is around 45k LOC.
